                <p>Samson was found with a huge hernia after stopping to move him and his puppy siblings from the middle of a busy road. 
                Samson was one of five puppies we took the long 20 hour journey to Kathmandu for surgery from AMC, Dr Sushil a few months ago. After the first consultation we made arrangements for Samson to have a hernia operation a week later. He would be fostered by Christina in Kathmandu until his recovery. 
                At his pre-operation appointment Dr Sushil noticed a significant change in the tear and decided that if it could repair on its own it was worth waiting to operate. His lovely foster Christina took him to his weekly appointments and after 5 weeks the hernia had repaired naturally. We are so happy for such an amazing recovery and he came home with us last week to Soltis Hope shelter!<br><br><br><br>
                Just over a month ago we rescued “ Zeus “ after a heavy blow to his eye caused proptosis. We immediately started treatment and the swelling decreased, but due to the dead tissue, large infection and corneal ulcer we were unable to save the eye. He is doing very well and this doesn’t affect him whatsoever. 
                When Zeus came to our shelter he was a very frightened puppy ( who can blame him ) he would keep far away from the humans and the other dogs alike. We gave him time to decompress, he watched closely as the others received love and attention and after a few weeks he’s like a different puppy ! He comes running now to get all the loves, sits on our laps, enjoys tummy rubs, plays with the other puppies ( especially his friend Colgate ) and loves going for walkies!</p>
